# Course program

The basic setup of the lessons is: start with some theory, do some exercises, and then do some independent work on (bigger) assignments.


:::{admonition} Program may vary
:class: warning

This schedule is a general idea; we will deviate from it depending on class learning pace and learning wishes.
