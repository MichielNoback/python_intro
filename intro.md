# A short Python intro

## Created for
This tutorial is created for use in Python introductory courses at Hanze University of Applied Science, Groningen, The Netherlands. 

## To get started
In order to program with Python you will need to have a Python interpreter on your machine. That is because Python is an interpreted language, not compiled.
If you never intend to use notebooks, simply download an interpreter for your machine from [python.org/](https://www.python.org/). However, if you want to use Jupyter notebooks and some more handy tools out-of-the box, go to [anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## How to use
This book contains a series of notebooks introducing programming concepts in Python in a data science setting. The raw notebooks can be downloaded or cloned from [Github](https://github.com/MichielNoback/python_intro).
You can view these notebooks interactively on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (but slow).  
Here is a direct link:

If you wish to work on the exercises, it is probably best to download this notebook to your local machine from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichielNoback/python_intro/master/11_exercises.ipynb). you will need Python and Jupyter installed of course.
