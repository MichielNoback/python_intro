    "\n",
    "1. **Break up the problem into manageable pieces**. When designing an algorithm, first think about which individual steps it involves. Then implement each step as a separate function.\n",
    "2. **Have functions do only one thing**. If your function apparantly does more than one thing, split it up!\n",
    "3. **Create small functions**. If your functions spans more than 30 lines it is probable too big, split it up! If it is indented by more than 3 levels, split it up!\n",
    "4. **Use names that mean something**. Use short but descriptive names. We are way past the era where function names could not be longer than 8 characters.\n",
    "5. **Verify function arguments**. For instance, if you get a negative elapsed time, is it still a good idea to carry on? We'll discuss error handling and Exceptions in a later chapter.\n",
    "6. **Write test code**. Something out of scope for this course, but very important nevertheless. Have a look at [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). \n"
