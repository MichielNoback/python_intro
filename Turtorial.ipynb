    "Fractals are typically known as line or pixel drawings, where you can zoom in to find that every small piece, at every level of magnification, shows the same pattern as the whole thing on the large scale. They are generated from mathematical rules, which are applied recursively. A simple example is the replacement of a single line by two lines under an angle, then replacing the two lines so obtained each by two lines under an angle, and continue this process up to infinity, the point where boredom sets in, or the point where the change is not noticeable anymore anyway.\n",
    "\n",

These types of fractals are known as [Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). As it's moves and turns, these can be nicely drawn with turtle graphics (providing a nice/typical showcase for recursive functions.\n",

This can be abbreviated as the movement string *'+F-F-F+'*, noting that the right and left turns have a fixed angle (90 degrees) and the length of a step is also fixed. The 'mirror image' of this pattern is *'-F+F+F-'*. This is the same pattern, but with reversal of the turns. We call these two the *'A'* and *'B'* sequences, and we change the sequences to include self-references, so we get replacement rules\n",
